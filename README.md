# Blog-Notifier

Blog-Notifier is a project developed for the GoLang track on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org), a hands-on learning platform.
It simplifies the management of favorite blog sites by providing email notifications whenever a new blog post is published on any blog in the user's watchlist. Users can easily add or remove blog sites from their watchlists.

## Project Description

The project is divided into five stages, each adding new functionalities and enhancing the user experience:

### Stage 1
Involves creating a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the key functionality of parsing YAML files. This allows the Blog Notifier CLI to dynamically read and apply configurations for email notifications, server settings, and integration with messaging platforms like Telegram.

### Stage 2
Enhances the Blog Notifier CLI to create a watchlist for favorite blogs and store that list in a SQLite database, enabling easier management and persistence of the watchlist.

### Stage 3
Introduces a CLI sub-command to crawl a website recursively to a specified depth, collecting links and presenting them in a user-friendly manner.

### Stage 4
Implements functionality to monitor specific blog sites for new content updates. Users can manage their list of blogs, check for new posts, and update their watchlist as needed.

### Stage 5
Introduces email notification functionality, sending notifications to users for new blog posts discovered on sites in their watchlist.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project offers valuable opportunities to master diverse skills in GoLang, including:
- Parsing YAML files
- Website crawling
- Sending emails
- Implementing concurrency
- Executing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
