<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage of the Blog Notifier project, you will add a new functionality to monitor specific blog sites for new content updates; this is akin to a personalized news feed where updates from favorite blogs are not missed. By implementing a command-line interface, users can interact with the program to manage their list of blogs, check for new posts, and update their watchlist.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your objective is to enhance the Blog Notifier command line tool by introducing a new flag, <code>--crawl</code>, to its functionality. The implementation of this flag should involve crawling all the websites currently listed in the <code>blogs</code> table (watch list). If new blog-posts are discovered during the crawl, they should be inserted into the <code>posts</code> table, and the <code>last_link</code> column for the corresponding blog should be updated with <strong>any</strong> newly found blog-post. This update is crucial for maintaining the latest information on the last visited link for each blog site.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this stage, a new sub-command <code>list-posts</code> will be created. This sub-command requires the <code>--site</code> flag and is designed to list all posts for a specific blog site. This feature enhances the utility of the CLI by providing users with a convenient way to view all posts associated with a particular blog site.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program will be tested for the flag <code>--crawl</code> and the sub-command <code>list-posts</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Using the <code>--crawl</code> flag</strong></p>

<p>Consider the existing blog sites currently listed in the <code>blogs</code> table (watch list) within the database.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>site</th>
    <th>last_link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog1</td>
    <td>post1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog2</td>
    <td>post1</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

<p>Imagine that there are recent additions to the two blog sites, <code>blog1</code> and <code>blog2</code>. To illustrate, <code>blog1</code> has introduced new blog-posts labeled <code>post_1</code> and <code>post_2</code>, while <code>blog2</code> now features additional posts identified as <code>post_a</code>, <code>post_b</code>, and <code>post_c</code>.</p>

<p>After executing the command <code>blognotifier --crawl</code>, the program is expected to discover new blog-posts from <code>blog1</code> and <code>blog2</code> and update the <code>posts</code> table. Following this update, the <code>posts</code> table should contain the following entries:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>site</th>
    <th>link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog1</td>
    <td>post_1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog1</td>
    <td>post_2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog2</td>
    <td>post_a</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog2</td>
    <td>post_b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog2</td>
    <td>post_c</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

<p>Also, the <code>last_link</code> column in the <code>blogs</code> table must be updated, it can be updated with any of the new blog-posts discovered on that blog site. The <code>blogs</code> table must look like the following example:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>site</th>
    <th>last_link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog1</td>
    <td>post_2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blog2</td>
    <td>post_c</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

<p>Note the <code>last_link</code> column for <code>blog1</code> could be either <code>post_1</code> or <code>post_2</code>. Similarly the <code>last_link</code> column for <code>blog2</code> could be either <code>post_a</code>, <code>post_b</code> or <code>post_c</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, your program will be tested for the sub-command, <code>list-posts</code>. Upon running the command <code>blognotifier list-posts --site blog2</code> the program should display a list all the blog-posts associated with the specified input(blog-site), which is <code>blog2</code> in this instance. The expected output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>blognotifier list-posts --site blog2
post_a
post_b
post_c</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, upon running the command <code>blognotifier list-posts --site blog1</code>, the expected output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>blognotifier list-posts --site blog1
post_1
post_2</code></pre>

<p>Please reuse the code from the previous stages. All the sub-commands from the previous stages will also be tested. Specifically we will test the following sub-commands</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--migrate</code></li>
  <li><code>--explore</code></li>
  <li><code>--list</code></li>
  <li><code>--crawl</code></li>
  <li><code>list-posts --site</code></li>
</ul>
